## Numbers

Base 17 for the 17 colleges 0-16. 

0 = ? 
1 = Chads
2 = Marys 
3 = Collingwood
4 = ? 
9 = ?
17 = ?
...

You can guess the remaining 7 by printing all colleges and seeing what happens

## Operators

Some colleges are operators:

`+` = addition
`-` = subtraction
`*` = multiplication
`/` = division
`%` = modulo

you can guess them too: 

E.g. 

`tlc(castle ustinov castle) = 25`
